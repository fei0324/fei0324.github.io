			<p>I am a mover and a lover of nature. Growing up, I have always been active, played sports at school, swimming on the weekends and going to dance classes. I minored in Dance in college and was fortunate to meet the amazing dance performer and educator Britta Peterson. She taught me much about the creative process and made me realize that it is not only about researching, but also about being aware of myself and the surroundings, and being reflective on my progress. I carried much of the mindset into my life outside of dance. I performed with the American University Dance Company in my junior year.</p>
			<p>After moving to Salt Lake City, I decided to take advantage of the beautiful nature Utah has to offer. I started doing weekend road trips, camping and backpacking. I learned to snowboard and also recently started bouldering.</p>

			<p><strong>Favorite National Park:</strong><br>
			Grand Teton National Park (so far, since I haven't traveled much in the PNW.) <br>
			Arches National Park also has a special place in my heart.
